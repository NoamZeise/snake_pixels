# snake_pixels
basic snake game made with the rust library [pixels](https://crates.io/crates/pixels).

main.rs uses code from the [pixels web example](https://github.com/parasyte/pixels/tree/main/examples/minimal-web)

each part of the snake's body and the food that spawns are single pixels. The snake wraps around the screen when it goes out of bounds.
